Part 1:

* Why was Go created when there are so many other languages already?

* The executable file that the compiler outputs is huge, while the source code file size is tiny. Why is that?

* Should I use `go build` or `go run`?

* What are the things you need to run a Go program?

* Can you explain the different between `go build` and `go run`?
